## 1. Configure Your Existing Google Sheet

Since you already have a Google Sheet created, we need to set it up with the proper structure for the application.

### Required Sheet Tabs

Your spreadsheet needs these three tabs (sheets):

1. Right-click on the sheet tab at the bottom
2. Select "Insert sheet"
3. Name it appropriately (Events, Registrations, Cultural Programs)
4. Click "Done"

## 2. Set up the required sheet structure:

### Sheet 1: Events
**Column Headers (Row 1):**
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Title | Date | Location | Description | Category | Organizer | Contact | Created At |

**Instructions:**
1. Go to the "Events" sheet
2. In row 1, add the headers exactly as shown above

## 3. Create Google Service Account

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google Sheets API and Google Drive API
4. Create a Service Account:
   - Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Fill in the details
   - Create and download the JSON key file
5. Share your Google Sheet with the service account email address (with Editor permissions)

## 4. Environment Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the flask_api directory
2. Update the following variables:
   - `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=1_PhI-Rrx6RMF45X7G1yO6lv7I22D4K1yoS1ZyUqza8I`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE`: Path to your service account JSON file

**Example .env file:**
```env
